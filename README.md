Project Status
--------------

[Version changelog](https://github.com/TES3MP/openmw-tes3mp/blob/master/tes3mp-changelog.md)

As of version 0.7.0, TES3MP is fully playable, providing very extensive player, NPC, world and quest synchronization, as well as state saving and loading, all of which are highly customizable via [serverside Lua scripts](https://github.com/TES3MP/CoreScripts).

Remaining gameplay problems mostly relate to AI and the synchronization of clientside script variables.
